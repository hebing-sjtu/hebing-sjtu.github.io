## 🚀 About Me
I am a PhD student at **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**, working at the intersection of **3D Vision** and **Neural Data Compression**. My research focuses on making 3D representations (like Gaussian Splatting) more efficient and robust, and leveraging state-of-the-art architectures (like Mamba) for image and video compression.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Internship Search:** I am currently seeking a Research Internship in the **United States (California preferred)** for 2026 and 2027. If you are working on 3DGS, generative modeling, or efficient codecs, I'd love to connect!

## 🛠 Featured Research

### 🟢 3D Vision & Graphics
**SurfSplat: Conquering Feedforward 2D Gaussian Splatting** *ICLR 2026* | [Project Page](https://hebing-sjtu.github.io/SurfSplat-website/)  
* Introducing surface continuity priors to 2DGS. No more artifacts—finally, high-fidelity 3DGS that holds up even under extreme zoom.

**H3D-DGS: Heterogeneous 3D Motion Representation** *NeurIPS 2025* | [Project Page](https://github.com/hebing-sjtu/H3D-DGS)  
* Tackling intense motion in deformable scenes. We combine neural networks with graphics priors to accelerate training and stabilize deformation.

### 🔵 Learned Image & Video Compression
**Content-Aware Mamba (CMIC)** *ICLR 2026* * Moving beyond rigid raster scans. We introduce a content-adaptive token permutation strategy for Mamba-style SSMs, achieving over **21% BD-rate savings** vs VTM-21.0.

**Knowledge Distillation for Learned Image Compression** **ICCV 2025(oral)** *  Knowledge distillation meets learned image compression! We’ve developed a streamlined framework that delivers a smaller, faster model with significantly reduced computational overhead, all while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.

**Implicit-Explicit Hybrid Multi-View Codec** *TIP 2025* * Solving the VR data bottleneck. A framework that fuses traditional 2D codecs with Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to outperform the MIV standard.

## 💻 Skills
* **Languages:** C++ (TA for Undergraduate C++), Python, Cython.
* **Frameworks:** PyTorch.
* **Expertise:** 3D Reconstruction, 3DGS, Rigging.
